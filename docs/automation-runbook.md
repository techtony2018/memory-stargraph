# Memory Stargraph Automation Runbook

Use this runbook for daily GBrain TODO implementation automation and any follow-up work that touches the user-facing Memory Stargraph services.

## Required Preflight

Run this before implementation work:

```bash
scripts/automation/preflight.sh
```

The preflight records the active `CODEX_HOME`, checks required binaries, probes the configured dashboard/local service, verifies Chrome CDP at `127.0.0.1:9333`, and checks configured remote health routes. Concrete deployment routes belong in the local-only config, not in the public repo.

## Deployment Targets

Keep deployment target details in local Codex memory/config and GBrain, not in tracked GitHub files. The deploy helper reads:

```bash
${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/automations/memory-stargraph-wish-to-reallity/deployment-targets.env
```

That local file should define the dashboard-managed local service path, restart URL, remote SSH targets, remote repo paths, restart commands, and verification URLs.

After commit and push, deploy the exact commit with:

```bash
scripts/automation/deploy_targets.sh V1.0.xx <commit>
```

Do not mark TODOs completed until all configured required targets report the expected `ui_version`, served HTML asset query strings, and served `public/app.js` version, or a target has a concrete unreachable/deployment reason recorded in local memory/GBrain.

## Remote Shell Rule

For remote host work, do not send complex inline SSH commands through the remote login shell. zsh/glob parsing has repeatedly broken commands that contain `[]`, `|`, `$()`, awk regexes, or nested quotes.

Use a heredoc into remote bash for anything beyond a trivial one-liner:

```bash
ssh toddy@host 'bash -s' <<'REMOTE'
set -euo pipefail
# commands here
REMOTE
```

Prefer simple process tools such as `pgrep -f`, `ps -p`, `case`, and `lsof` over fragile awk regexes inside quoted SSH strings. If a command must run under zsh and uses globs, explicitly guard with `setopt nonomatch`; otherwise avoid zsh parsing entirely by using `bash -s`.

## Browser Verification

Use Chrome CDP first for UI verification:

```bash
npx --yes --package playwright node scripts/automation/cdp_probe.mjs V1.0.xx http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Use `tests/browser_smoke.mjs` as broad regression coverage, but keep it from overfitting unrelated layout details. When smoke fails on stale layout assertions, add or update targeted CDP probes for the feature being shipped and fix stale smoke assertions separately.

## Five-Minute Retrospective Hook

Every automation run that lasts more than five minutes must end with a short retrospective before the final report. Capture:

- What slowed the run down.
- Any stale assumption, flaky check, missing command, or unreachable host.
- One concrete improvement to scripts, docs, automation prompt, or tests.
- Whether the improvement was implemented immediately.

Append the retrospective with:

```bash
scripts/automation/retrospect.sh memory-stargraph-wish-to-reallity <elapsed-seconds> /path/to/summary.md
```

If the run is under five minutes, note that the hook was skipped.
